# To-Do-List
This project is a simple ToDo list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to:

-> Add new tasks via an input field and button.
<br>
-> Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them (striking them through).
<br>
-> Remove tasks using a delete button.

The HTML provides the structure, CSS styles the list for a clean look, and JavaScript handles the functionality (adding, completing, and removing tasks). This app is responsive and provides a basic understanding of creating interactive web applications.
